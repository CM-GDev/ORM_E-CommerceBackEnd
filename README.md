  ## Description
  
  - This is my first homework assignment using a Node.js Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for the Full Stack Web Developer course I'm enrolled in. The assigment was to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code.
  - By completing this assignment, I was able to implement lessons from my course, including:
    - Configure a working Express.js API
    - Use Sequelize ORM to interact with a MySQL database
    - Use Insomnia API Client to test my final product
    - Utilize several npm packages
    - Establish Express.js routes to deploy the application
    - Run asynchronous queries
  - See the Usage Information of this README for a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates the appication's functionality using Insomnia.
  
  The following is a screenshot of the final version of the application tested with Insomnia
